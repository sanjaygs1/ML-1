In this project, I utilized Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build classification models aimed at predicting whether a red wine is classified as “good quality.” Each wine in the dataset is assigned a quality score ranging from 1 to 10. For simplicity, I transformed these scores into two categories:

Good quality Wines with a score of 6 or higher.
Not good quality Wines with a score below 6.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and relationships between the wine's physicochemical properties and its quality. By applying various machine learning models, the goal is to predict wine quality and understand the key factors that contribute to a higher rating.

The dataset includes 11 features that describe the physicochemical properties of the wines, which were used as input variables for the models. These features are:
Fixed acidity,
Volatile acidity,
Citric acid,
Residual sugar,
Chlorides,
Free sulfur dioxide,
Total sulfur dioxide,
Density,
pH,
Sulphates,
Alcohol.

Using these features, I experimented with multiple classification algorithms to understand what makes a wine “good quality” and how well the models can predict quality based on the given data.

Steps used in this project: 
Importing Libraries,
Loading the Dataset,
Understanding the Dataset Structure,
Handling Missing Data,
Analyzing Variables (Exploratory Data Analysis),
Selecting Relevant Features,
Assessing the Distribution of Good vs. Bad Wines,
Preparing the Data for Modeling,
Testing Various Machine Learning Models,
Selecting the Best-Performing Model.

Objective of this Project: 
To evaluate multiple classification approaches and identify the method that achieves the highest predictive performance for determining wine quality.
